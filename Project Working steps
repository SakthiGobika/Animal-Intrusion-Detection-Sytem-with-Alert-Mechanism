🚀 Working Steps

Step 1: Data Collection

Collect images/videos of animals (dogs, cows, monkeys, cats, etc.).

Use Kaggle datasets or capture your own using a webcam.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Resize all images to a fixed size.

Label animal regions using tools like LabelImg.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Step 3: Model Training

Train a deep learning model (YOLOv5/YOLOv8, CNN, or MobileNet-SSD).

The model learns animal features such as shape and texture.

Save the trained model weights for detection.

Step 4: Real-Time Video Stream Setup

Use OpenCV to read frames from a webcam or CCTV feed.

Each frame is processed and sent to the model.

Step 5: Animal Detection

The model detects animals in the frame with confidence scores.

Bounding boxes and class labels are displayed on the video feed.

Step 6: Alert Mechanism

If an animal is detected:

Send an SMS alert (Twilio API)

Or send an email alert (SMTP)

Or activate a buzzer/sound alarm (if hardware connected)

Step 7: Logging and Storage

Save detection details such as timestamp, animal name, and snapshot.

Maintain logs for future analysis and security review.

Step 8: System Output

Shows real-time detection on screen.

Alerts are triggered immediately.

Logs/images are stored in the project folder.
