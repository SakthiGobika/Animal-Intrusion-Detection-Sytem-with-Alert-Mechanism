This project is an AI-based Animal Intrusion Detection System designed to monitor real-time video streams using a webcam or CCTV camera.

It uses a trained deep learning model (YOLO/CNN) to detect animals entering restricted or sensitive areas.

When an intrusion is detected, the system activates an alert mechanism such as SMS, email, or sound alarms.

The system helps prevent crop damage, property loss, and safety risks by providing instant warnings.
