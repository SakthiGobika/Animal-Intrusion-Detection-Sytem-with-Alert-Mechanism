Animal Intrusion Detection System with Alert Mechanism

This project uses a deep learning model (YOLO/CNN) to detect animals in real-time using webcam or CCTV video. When an intrusion is detected, the system triggers alerts through SMS, email, or sound notifications. It helps protect farmland, storage areas, and private property by providing fast early warnings.
